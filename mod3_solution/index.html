              Ask questions in Discussions if you get stuck! We are all learning, and going through getting stuck and
              then unstuck (even with someone's help) can be a very valuable learning experience!
              Don't get scared by the number of points below. Most of it is NOT graded and is optional for you to try on
              your own.<br>
              Here is what you will need to complete the assignment:<br>
              1. (If you haven't already) Create a GitHub.com account and a repository that you will use for this class.<br>
              2. (If you haven't already) Follow the Development Setup Video (beginning of Module 1) instructions on<br>
              how to create a repository and set it up such that you can host and view your finished web pages on
              GitHub Pages, i.e., GitHub.io domain name. You will need to provide that URL for your peer review.<br>
              3. Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your solution to this
              assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example, module3-solution or mod3_solution , etc.
              Create an index.html file inside the solution container folder, e.g., module3-solution/index.html .

              The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shownbelow. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop and tablet (same), mobile, and mobile with mobile menudropdown shown. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page. In other words, you will be creating asingle, responsive page.<br>
